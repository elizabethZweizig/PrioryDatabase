    <!-- /etc/apache2/apache2.conf -->
    <li>What command can you type into the terminal to check if apache is currently running?</li>
    <p>service apache2 status</p>

    <li>What is the difference between ServerRoot and DocumentRoot?</li>
    <p>DocumentRoot is path to the files deliverable by the server. ServerRoot is path to executable in the server directory.</p>

    <li>What port does your web server listen to for HTTP connections from browsers? Can you change this port?</li>
    <p>HTTP is port 80. Change this port with "Listen &lt;new port>" in the ports.conf file.</p>

    <li>In what directory do you need to place all of your HTML and PHP documents for apache to serve them up?
      Test by navigating to this directory, and if your hunch is right, you should find some It Worked! HTML document.</li>
      <p>HTML and PHP files should be put in the /var/www/html/ directory.</p>

    <li>What file contains all of Apache's traffic logs? What about its error logs?</li>
    <p>Traffic logs are in /var/log/apache2/access.log. Error logs are in /var/log/apache2/error.log.</p>

    <li>What is a directory index file? Why would it be nice to have one in each directory?</li>
    <p>A directory index file is an html file (usually called index.html) that contains a list of filenames.
    DirectoryIndex sets a list of resources to look for when the client requests the directory index.
    This can be used to navigate through a site.</p>

    <li>How do you give every user on your Linux machine their own web space? Look into public_html?</li>
    <p>Public_html is the directory where all users can put their html files so all clients can have access to the files.
    These pages can generally be accessed with http://your_IP_addr/~username</p>

    <li>How do you create a password protected directory (like I did for the class notes)? Look into .htpasswd and .htaccess files.</li>
    <p>The .htaccess file provides a directory at root level that requires valid user info to be accessed.
      The .htpasswd file contains usernames and passwords for the page or directory.</p>

    <li>When the browser tries to access a page that doesn’t exist, the HTTP protocol issues a 404 error code.
      There’s a way to send the browser to a particular document upon issuing this error. How?</li>
    <p>You can use a page redirect to send the browser to a particular page after a 404 error with
      &lt;meta HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT="5; URL=otherPage.htm">.</p>

    <li>Apache implements the HTTP protocol. The protocol is extremely simple, with just a few commands.
      What is the difference between the GET, POST, and HEAD commands?</li>
    <p>GET: used to retrieve data</p>
    <p>POST: used to send data to the server - uses HTML forms</p>
    <p>HEAD: like GET, but only sends the status line and header data</p>
  </ol>
